# DEPRECATED

# BrainSyncAi
 A simple php website that generates binaural beats for any purpose using insights from ChatGPT.
 The binaural beats generated by BrainSyncAi are intended for relaxation, focus, sleep aid, and similar applications. It's best served over your favorite music or sounds.

## How to setup

### Requirements 

- PHP 8.1+
- Curl
- ChatGPT API Key
- Database

### Setup

1. Upload to environment
2. Run `composer install`
3. Create a database and add the brainsyncai.sql to the SQL database
5. Add database details to the env
6. Add a chatGPT api into the env
7. Add URL to the env
8. Rename the env to .env
9. Launch the website

### Note

This uses PHP to create the WAV files and is not efficient. So it does require quite a bit of RAM. I have it overidding the php.ini with 1G of ram. (We can probably come up with a better way to do this.)

### Disclaimer

This was just a quick project I came up with and results could differ. I used chatGPT to help write the code as a of chat's capabilities. It performed well in some areas and horribly in others, but overall it was impressive to see what it came up with-Although writing this now, if I did this project again, Chat GPT 4o would probably perform wonders? Maybe. Either way this is now deprecated, but I am leaving this here as a testiment of where we started with ai.
